```

## Usage Examples

### Typical Usage
```typescript
// User selects:

{
  breakfast: 0,
  lunch: 5,
  dinner: 7
}

```

## Error Handling

### Survey Not Completed
```typescript
if (!userData?.survey_response) {
  return {
    error: 'Please complete the onboarding survey first',
    needsSurvey: true
  }
}
```
Automatically redirects to `/onboarding` after 2 seconds.

### No Meals Selected
```typescript
if (totals.total === 0) {
  setError('Please select at least one meal to generate')
  return
}
```

### AI Generation Fails
- Shows error message
- User can retry
- Previous selections preserved

### Database Save Fails
- Shows error message
- Raw AI response still visible
- User can retry

## Performance

### Current
- Average generation time: 5-10 seconds
- Depends on OpenAI API response time
- Database operations are fast (<1s)

### Optimization Ideas
- Stream AI responses for progress updates
- Cache common meal combinations
- Parallel database inserts
- Pre-generate popular meal plans

## Monitoring

Track these metrics:
```sql
-- Average meals per plan
SELECT AVG(total_meals) FROM meal_plans;

-- Most common meal counts
SELECT total_meals, COUNT(*) 
FROM meal_plans 
GROUP BY total_meals 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Generation success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at IS NOT NULL) as successful,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM meal_plans;

-- Popular meal types
SELECT 
  meal_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM meal_plan_recipes
GROUP BY meal_type;
```

## API Costs

**OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini):**
- Input: $0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: $0.60 per 1M tokens

**Average meal plan (12 meals):**
- Input: ~2,000 tokens = $0.0003
- Output: ~3,000 tokens = $0.0018
- **Total: ~$0.002 per meal plan**

Very affordable! Even with 1000 meal plans = $2

## Support

If users encounter issues:

1. **Check survey completion**: User must complete onboarding first
2. **Check OpenAI API key**: Must be configured in environment
3. **Check database tables**: All tables must exist
4. **Check network**: User needs stable connection
5. **Check logs**: Server logs show detailed errors

## Summary

The new meal plan generator provides a modern, intuitive interface that:
- âœ… Removes the confusing text input
- âœ… Uses survey data automatically
- âœ… Provides visual meal selection
- âœ… Matches your design system
- âœ… Integrates seamlessly with existing flow
