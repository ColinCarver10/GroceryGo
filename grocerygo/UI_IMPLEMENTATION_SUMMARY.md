## üîú Next Steps: Backend Integration

When ready to implement functionality, you'll need to:

1. **Create reusable AI prompt function** (as requested)
2. **Implement server actions** in `actions.ts`:
   - `replaceRecipe(mealPlanId, recipeId, mealType, surveySnapshot)`
   - `regenerateWithAdjustments(mealPlanId, adjustments)`
   - `excludeIngredient(userId, ingredientName)`
   - `favorIngredient(userId, ingredientName)`
   - `scaleRecipe(recipeId, multiplier)`
   - `swapIngredient(recipeId, oldIngredient, newIngredient)`
   - `simplifyRecipe(recipeId)`

3. **Database changes:**
   - User preferences table (for blacklist/whitelist)
   - Recipe scaling metadata
   - Meal plan history/versioning

4. **AI Integration:**
   - Create generic `callOpenAI(prompt, data)` function
   - Build dynamic prompts based on action type
   - Parse and validate AI responses
